Experience

-------
# Associate Director, Bioinformatics

Pandemic Response Lab (PRL)
New York City, NY
Jun 2022 - Present

-   Provided subject matter expertise on the streamlining and automation of end to end NGS lab operations: sample accessioning, LIMS design, bioinformatic and QC analysis, report generation and data delivery.
-   Designed the architecture and supervised the development of a NextFlow based modular environment to fully automate all bioinformatic steps, including integration with in-house LIMS system, QC analysis, and data storage/delivery.
-   Supervised implementation of a QC bioinformatics pipeline to assist R&D efforts on the development of a hybrid capture oncological panel.
-   Supervised team operations for multiple workflows delivering data to customers within a tight schedule, including COVID-19 surveillance from both clinical and wastewater samples, RNA-seq, hybrid capture, whole-genome and plasmid sequencing.

# Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core Director, Assistant Investigator

The Forsyth Institute
Cambridge, MA
Nov/2017 - Aug/2019

-   Developed and validated a comprehensive workflow for analysis of 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing data that uses a training set derived from the Expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD) in conjunction with high-resolution algorithms, to allow species-level identification of oral, nasal and skin bacteria.
-   Supervised improvements on the 16S rRNA gene V1-V3 microbiome NGS library preparation to achieve longer and more informative reads that, combined with the use of eHOMD, allowed an even higher percentage of species-level assignment. 
-   Managed the team of research associates and bioinformaticians on the day to day operations of the Core to serve internal and external clients (academic collaborations and commercial services).
